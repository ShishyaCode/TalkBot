# 🗣️ TalkBot – Telegram User-to-Admin Communication Bot

**TalkBot** is a Telegram bot that allows users to contact the bot owner or admin directly. It's like a simple **chat bridge**, where messages sent by users are forwarded to the admin, and the admin's can reply them in private 

This is perfect for:

- Support bots
- Personal assistant bots
- Anonymous Q&A bots
- User feedback systems
